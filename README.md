# Project 0 - My Personal Website

## Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

It is my first project in the area of web development. I have been introduced to HTML at school but those were mainly small projects involving plain HTML and less than a page of code.

After seeing the lectures 0 and 1, I proceeded to write code for the project devloping on the topics introduced int the lectures.

I have used HTML, CSS, SCSS and Bootstrap to build the website. It consists for 4 pages, one homepage index.html and three pages about.html, time_table.html and contact.html which can be reached from the homepage. All the pages excetp the homepage have a link through which the homepage can be reached.

### Index.html
This is the homepage of my personal website. It contains a background image of me. In the center, it has a short description of me and a link "Learn more about me" which leads to about.html. The top bar has 2 sections. The one on the left tells my nickname. The one on the right has 2 links "Time Table" and "Contact", which lead to time_table.html and contact.html respectively.

### About.html
This page contains information about the things that I do in college like my internships, my positions of responsibilities and TV series that I have watched. It uses 3 Bootstrap columns, and each column has a header, background coloring text coloring and the information is displayed using unordered list. It also uses the SCSS nesting property.

### Time_table.html
This page has the academic time table of my 4th semester in college. I used HTML tables to display the contents and many css selectors like .class, h1, #id were used to give attributes to the individual cells of the table as well as the headings.

### Contact.html
This page contains links to my email, Facebook profile and LinkedIn profile. I have used the component card of Bootstrap to display the information in the form of a card along with title, background coloring and text alignment. I have also used the inheritance property of SCSS to define common properties to the three links and specific properties were defined using the "extend" feature.

The latter 3 pages contais a link to the homepage index.html at the footer of the page.
